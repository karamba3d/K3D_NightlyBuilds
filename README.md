# Karamba3D NightlyBuilds
The Karamba3D builds in this directory are work in progress (WIP).
This repository contains the nightly builds version of Karamba3D for Rhino6 and Rhino7. Rhino5 is no longer supported.

Please be aware of the following:
- these builds may contain bugs because they are not as thoroughly tested as official versions of Karamba3D.
- Grasshopper definitions created with these WIP builds may contain components which do not load correctly in later versions of Karamba3D.

Best regards,
your Karamba3D team
